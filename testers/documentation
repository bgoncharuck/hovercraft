// SERVER
The server is divided to 4 stages.
1 : Pins, variables that can be changed in start of code
and will be used in all following code
2 : Setup of pins and server, setup of wifi
3 : loop with mini-event system
4 : functions implementations

every function is descripted in it`s source

// APP (CLIENT)

client needs to be connected to same wifi network
as the server (usually it is dummy network from smartphone)

next you need to know ip of server; for ours wifi point it`s
default and never changes, so it`s hardcoded in start
(but can be changed)

when you write correct ip
you can switch on the airDriver
only after doing that you can use other options

hovercraft has 3 speed levels
and it can change air stream to left - right
also it has buttons for stop and set max speed
